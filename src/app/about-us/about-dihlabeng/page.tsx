          Of a total farmland area of ± 3 000 ha in the Eastern Free State, 34%
          thereof is located within the Dihlabeng area – a factor that confirms
          the Agricultural comparative advantage that the sub region has in the
          Free State Province. The normal industrial incentives, with specific
          reference to affordable purchase prices, endorsed by Dihlabeng Local
          Council, ensure growth in the epithelium industrial area. The
          significance of the Lesotho Highlands Water and the Bethlehem Hydro
          Electricity projects are also relevant in this regard. Upmarket
          Residential, Business and Tourism development of a large scale is

          activities will result in future economic growth in the Agriculture
          sector. Effective productive grazing and small scale farming
          programmes on the existing and identified land for commonage have
          future growth potential. As part of Government’s Land Reform
          Programme, emerging farmers are trained and supported to ensure
          productive farming practices, which ensures economic growth in
          Dihlabeng.
